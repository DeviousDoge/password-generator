# password-generator

## Description

I had to provide functionality to an app that was meant to generate a random password based on certain user criteria. User was meant to decide the length of the password and what characters to use. The script was very incomplete when I took over this project but the HTML and CSS was working and functional. 

The app sends a series of window messages that asks both

A)How many times the index of characters is pulled from and applied to password 

B)Which of the predetermined indexes of character gets applied to the master index

The app then chooses a random number to choose from the index, and then applies that index item once to the password, and repeats this process the same amount of times as the number chosen in the first prompt. The final password is displayed in the empty box above the 'generate password' button.
